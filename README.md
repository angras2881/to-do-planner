To-Do Planner QA Project
A web application tested with manual and automated (Cypress) QA processes to ensure functionality and reliability. This project demonstrates my skills in test automation, manual testing, and defect reporting.

## About
Built a simple to-do planner app (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to practice QA. Created and executed automated tests using Cypress and manual test cases to validate features like task creation, deletion, and status updates.

## QA Contributions
- **Automated Testing**: Wrote 10+ Cypress tests to validate UI functionality (e.g., task creation, form validation).
- **Manual Testing**: Developed 15 test cases covering functional, edge-case, and usability scenarios.
- **Bug Reports**: Identified and documented 5 bugs with clear reproduction steps.

## Setup and Running Tests
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/angras2881/To-Do-Planner-QA`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run Cypress tests: `npx cypress run`
4. View manual test cases in `/Manual-Testing/Test-Cases.md`
