# To-DO Planner-QA Project
A web application tested with automated (Cypress) and manual QA processes to ensure reliable task management. This project showcases my 7+ years of QA experience, refreshed with modern tools after earning Associate and Bachelorâ€™s degrees.

## About
I developed and tested this to-do planner (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to demonstrate end-to-end QA skills, including test automation, manual test case design, and defect reporting.

## QA Contributions
- **Automated Testing**: 7+ Cypress tests for task creation, completion, deletion, and edge cases in `/cypress/e2e`.
- **Manual Testing**: 15 test cases and 5 bug reports for functional, usability, and edge-case testing in `/Manual-Testing`.
- **Skills**: Cypress, JavaScript, Manual Testing, Test Case Design, Defect Reporting, Git.
