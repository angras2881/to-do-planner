# To-Do Planner QA Project
A web application tested with automated (Cypress) and manual QA processes to ensure reliable task management. This project showcases my 7+ years of QA experience, refreshed with modern tools after earning Associate and Bachelorâ€™s degrees.

## About
I built and tested this to-do planner (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to demonstrate end-to-end QA skills, including test automation, manual testing, and defect reporting.

## QA Contributions
- **Automated Testing**: 7+ Cypress tests for task creation, completion, deletion, and edge cases (see `/cypress/e2e`).
- **Manual Testing**: 15 test cases and 5 bug reports for functional and usability testing (see `/Manual-Testing`).
- **Skills**: Cypress, JavaScript, Manual Testing, Git.

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/angras2881/To-Do-Planner-QA`
2. Install: `npm install`
3. Run tests: `npx cypress run` or `npx cypress open`
